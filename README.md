# image-to-pencil-sketch-app
The  project is a basic image to pencil sketch converter application built using Python and several libraries, including OpenCV, Pillow (PIL), and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a basic summary of the project:
Project Name: Image to Pencil Sketch Converter

Description:
This project creates a simple desktop application that allows users to convert a selected image into a pencil sketch. The application features a user-friendly GUI with a "Open Image" button to select an image file. Once an image is selected, the application processes it using image processing techniques to create a pencil sketch and displays the sketch in the same window.

Key Components:

OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks such as grayscale conversion, inversion, Gaussian blur, and division to create the sketch effect.

Pillow (PIL): Used to convert the processed image into a format suitable for displaying in the Tkinter GUI.

Tkinter: Provides the graphical user interface for the application, including a button for opening an image and a label for displaying the converted sketch.

How to Use:

Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
The application window will appear with an "Open Image" button.
Click the "Open Image" button to select an image file from your computer.
The selected image will be processed to create a pencil sketch.
The converted sketch will be displayed in the application window.
Further Improvements:

You can enhance this project by adding features like the ability to save the converted sketch to a file.
Implement options for adjusting the sketch effect parameters such as blur intensity.
Enhance the user interface with additional buttons or menus for improved user interaction.
Error handling and validation can be added to handle various scenarios, such as invalid file formats.
This project serves as a basic example of creating a simple image processing application with a GUI, and it can be further extended and customized based on specific requirements and user preferences.
